According to the equation of electric field, the distance of the point on which the electric field is to be determined from the center is inversely proportional to the electric field. Thus, if the point is closer to the center, electric field will be higher because the distance will be smaller. But if the point is far, its distance will be bigger. So, the electric field will be smaller.
